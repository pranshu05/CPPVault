## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a platform for the students and developers to learn and understand the concepts of CPP in a better way. This project will provide a detailed documentation of the CPP concepts and will also provide the code snippets for the same. The project will be open source so it allows the user to update or create the documentations.

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed in a way that it is easy to understand and navigate. The project is divided into two main parts: `src/docs` and `src/` folder. The src/docs folder contains all the mdx files which are the documentation files.

## Contribution Guidelines

-   For documentation create a mdx file in the `src/docs` folder.
-   Name the file in the `index_category_name.mdx` formate. For example: `1_DS_arrays.mdx`, `2_DS_linkedlist.mdx`... etc.
-   Add frontmatter of the mdx similar to the given example below:

```mdx
---
title: 'Array'
description: 'Arrays using CPP'
readTime: 10
category: 'DS'
tags: [array, data-structures]
---
```

-   Please not that while adding a new category, write the category name in `ALLCAPS` case. for example: `DS`, `DSA`, `OOP`...etc
