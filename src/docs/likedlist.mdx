# Linked List

![Linked List](https://github.com/pranshu05/pranshu05/assets/70943732/c4dc0cc7-82ff-444b-a360-b8b58f0bbac3)

Linked List is a list of nodes. Node has two parts, one part containing the data and the other part containing the address of the next node of the list.

```cpp
struct Node{
    int data; //4 bytes
    Node* next; //4 bytes
}
```

The first node is called the head node. The only information we keep for the list is the address of the head node. The address of the head node gives us access to the complete list. The address of the last node is NULL/0.

## Types of Linked List

-   Single Linked List: Navigation is forward only.
-   Doubly Linked List: Both Forward and Backward navigation is possible.
-   Circular Linked List: The last node is linked to the first node.

## Implementation (Singly Linked List)

### Creating a Node

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

int main() {
    Node* head = nullptr;
    head = new Node();

    head->data = 1;
    head->next = nullptr;

    // Printing the node data
    cout << "Node data: " << head->data << endl;

    delete head; // Don't forget to free memory

    return 0;
}
```

#### Output:

```sh
Node data: 1
```

### Creating a Linked List

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

int main() {
    Node* head = nullptr;
    head = new Node();
    head->data = 1;
    head->next = nullptr;

    Node* second = new Node();
    second->data = 2;
    second->next = nullptr;
    head->next = second;

    Node* third = new Node();
    third->data = 3;
    third->next = nullptr;
    second->next = third;

    // Printing the linked list
    cout << "Linked List: ";
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != nullptr) {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Freeing memory
    delete head;
    delete second;
    delete third;

    return 0;
}
```

You can also achieve the same thing by:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

int main() {
    Node* head = new Node{1, nullptr}; // Create first node and initialize its data
    Node* second = new Node{2, nullptr}; // Create second node and initialize its data
    Node* third = new Node{3, nullptr}; // Create third node and initialize its data

    // Link nodes
    head->next = second;
    second->next = third;

    // Printing the linked list
    cout << "Linked List: ";
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != nullptr) {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Freeing memory
    delete head;
    delete second;
    delete third;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Output:

```sh
Linked List: 1 2 3
```

This method creates unnecessary pointers which creates memory that is not useful. Below is the most optimized method to create a Linked List.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node{
    int data;
    Node* link;
};

int main(){
    Node* head = new Node();
    head->data = 1;
    head->link = nullptr;

    Node* current = new Node();
    current->data = 2;
    current->link = nullptr;
    head->link = current;

    current = new Node();
    current->data = 3;
    current->link = nullptr;

    head->link->link = current;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we are accessing the address of all the nodes of the list using the sequential link arrow function, so we need not create any extra pointers and move the head pointer.

### Traversing a single Linked List

It is a method to go through each node of a Linked List from the beginning until the end node is reached.

#### Count number of nodes in a Linked List

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node{
    int data;
    Node* link;
};

void countNodes(Node *head){
    int count = 0;
    if (head == nullptr)
        cout << "Linked List is empty!";
    Node* ptr = nullptr;
    ptr = head;
    while(ptr != nullptr){
        count++;
        ptr = ptr -> link;
    }
    cout << count;
}

int main(){
    countNodes(head); //assuming that a Linked List exist

    return 0;
}
```

#### Print the data of a list

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node{
    int data;
    Node* link;
}

void printData(Node* head){
    if(head == nullptr)
        cout << "List is empty!";
    Node* ptr = nullptr;
    ptr = head;

    while(ptr != nullptr){
        cout << ptr->data;
        ptr = ptr->link;
    }
}

int main(){
    printData(head);//assuming that a Linked List exist

    return 0;
}
```

### Insert a node at the end of a list

Let's say that there is a list containing 3 nodes, and there's a node that we want to insert. We will assign a temp pointer to the node which we want to insert at the end.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node{
    int data;
    Node* link;
};

void insertAtEnd(Node* head, int data){
    Node* ptr, *temp;
    ptr = head;
    temp = new Node();

    temp -> data = data;
    temp -> link = nullptr;

    while(ptr -> link != nullptr){
        ptr = ptr -> link;
    }
    ptr->link = temp;
}

int main(){
    insertAtEnd(head, 123);

    return 0;
}
```

### Optimal code to create a Linked List using insertAtEnd function

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node{
    int data;
    Node* link;
};

Node* insertAtEnd(Node* ptr, int data){
    Node* temp = new Node();
    temp->data = data;
    temp->link = nullptr;

    ptr->link = temp;
    return temp;
}

int main(){
    Node* head = new Node();
    head->data = 1;
    head->link = nullptr;

    Node* ptr = head;
    ptr = insertAtEnd(ptr, 2);
    ptr = insertAtEnd(ptr, 3);
    ptr = insertAtEnd(ptr, 4);

    ptr = head;//move the pointer back to the head node after adding all the elements

    while(ptr != nullptr){
        cout << ptr->data;
        ptr = ptr->link;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Insert a node at the beginning of a list

#### Abstract code:

```cpp
ptr -> link = head;

head = ptr;
```

Here the head is the first node of the list and ptr points to the node that we want to insert at the beginning.

### Insert a new node at a given position in a list

Assuming that we already have a linked list and we want to insert a new node at the third position. We will create a new node (ptr2 pointing to it) first, and then we will need to traverse the list(ptr pointer). Now we will traverse the list till the node just before the position we want to insert the new node. (in this case till the 2<sup>nd</sup> node).

```cpp
ptr2->link = ptr->link
//this joins the new node with the 3rd node
ptr->link = ptr2
//this joins the 2nd node with the inserted node
```

### Delete the first node of a list

To achieve this we need to create a pointer which points to the first node of the list and we'll have to move the head pointer to the 2<sup>nd</sup> node and we'll free the memory of the temp pointer.

```cpp
//In this function we are passing the head function and we return the updated head.
Node* delFirst(Node* head){
	if(head == nullptr)
		cout << "List is empty!";
	else{
		Node* temp = head;
		head = head*link;
		free(temp);
		temp = nullptr;
	}
	return head;
}
```

### Delete the last node of a list

Suppose we already have a Linked List and we want to delete the last node of it. We will create a temp pointer pointing to the first node of the list and we'll need to traverse the list. For that we will keep two pointers. One pointer will stop at the last node and the other will stop at the second last node of the list.

```cpp
temp1->link = nullptr; //remove the link between the second last and the last node

free(temp2); //Delete the last node
temp2 = bullptr;
```

#### Can I use only 1 temp ptr?

Yes! we can achieve it by using only 1 pointer. We will move the temp pointer to the second last node of the list and we'll free memory of the last node using the temp pointer.

```cpp
free(temp->link);
temp->link = nullptr;
```

### Delete a node at the given position in a list

For this we will create 2 temp pointers pointing to the first node of the list. We'll move the first pointer to the node before the node which we want to delete and the second one to the node which we want to delete. Now we will update the link of the 1<sup>st</sup> pointer and free the memory of the second pointer.

```cpp
temp1->link = temp2->link;
free(temp2);
temp2 = nullptr;
```
